- Google Drive:(Lavanya Goluguri):
My main task for this project is to work on the drive data, find its anomalies, patterns, distributions and predictions.
In the work of progress towards this task, I have selected the important metrics in the drive data and applied time series analysi on the 
data. To discuss about it in detail my Machine learning analysis is as stated below.

So, the metrics that are mainly focused on in the drive data are:
1day_active_users
30day_active_users
Google_forms_created
Google_forms_edited
Google_documents_created
Google_documents_edited
Google_presentations_created
Google_presentations_edited
Google_Spreadsheets_created
Google_spreadsheets_edited
Google_drawings_created
Google_drawings_edited

I considered these as those point to how much content is being created, and how much is being actually collaborated/updated after creation.
